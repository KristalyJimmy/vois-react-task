    1. Product Listing Page
        The main page displays a collection of product cards, each with an image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

    2. Tooltip on Hover
        A tooltip appears when hovering over the ? icon on a product card. The tooltip displays a short description and key features of the item. It is responsive and adjusts its position if there's not enough space on the screen.

    3. Add to Cart
        Each product can be added to the cart. The cart keeps track of the number of items and calculates the total order value.
